        <h2>Biography</h2>
        <div><p> He was born and raised on the road in Faerun.  His parents travelled the world with him as merchants trading their wares wherever they could.  
            The only way he could pass the time was by reading whatever books he had in his possession and because of this, his parents constantly had to buy him books to 
            keep him occupied.  When he came of age and his parents taught him all they could, they abandoned him in a city leaving him to fend for himself.</p>
            <p>He quickly found a job apprenticing at a local library so that he could get unlimited access to all the books he could want.  He learned how to cast spells as well 
            as how to create his own magical items which he sold to make a living for himself. The only problem is, he never learned how to make permanent enchantments so he would 
            sell an enchanted item to a client and leave town before the enchantment faded. This obviously created a lot of enemies for him but he got rather good at the game and 
            has created legitimate aliases that he can use in the empire.</p>        
            <p>His travels he has heard rumors of a cave that holds magical secrets near the town of Phandelin and while he was fleeing a town nearby after a successful con, 
            he decided to ask around town about the cave.  He met a man named Sildar who pointed him in the direction of a group of newcomers that seem to be on the same path.</p></div>
